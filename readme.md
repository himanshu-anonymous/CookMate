## The Problem
71% of Gen Z actively seek healthy options, but only **11% cook daily**. The intent is there, but the infrastructure is missing.
For young adults, the kitchen is a source of anxiety, decision fatigue, and the "Learning Tax"—the cost of not knowing how to manage ingredients, leading to **3x more spending on takeout**.

## The Solution
**CookMate** is an Intelligent Cooking Operating System. We don't just teach recipes; we prevent a decade of poor health outcomes.
* **Inventory Aware:** Snap a photo of your fridge; our AI tells you what to cook.
* **Persona-Driven:** Motivation that fits you (Gym Bro, Indian Mom, or Hosteler).
* **Zero Friction:** No subscriptions. No gated content.

## Key Features
- **Smart Pantry:** AI Computer Vision to detect ingredients from a single photo.
- **Dynamic Recipe Engine:** Generates recipes based on your specific inventory and effort level (Lazy vs. Chef).
- **Voice Mentor:** A stateful AI that guides you step-by-step (e.g., "Is the pan hot enough?").
- **Adaptive Personas:** AI personalities that change tone to keep you motivated.
